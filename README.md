# Five-Stage Pipelined RV32I CPU

This repository contains the development of a 32-bit RV32I
RISC-V processor using a classic five-stage pipeline
(IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB).

The design will be implemented and simulated using
Xilinx Vivado. RTL design sources and simulation
testbenches will be added incrementally as the project
progresses.

This project is intended for academic and research use,
with a focus on pipeline behavior, hazard handling, and
performance evaluation.
